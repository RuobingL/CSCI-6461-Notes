Lecture 3 - Instruction Set Architecture
----------------------------------------

- ISA - visible to assembly level programmers/compilers
    - Not microinstructions
    - Important design issue for CPU designers
        - Features can be added to the CPU after original design is obsolete
        - Difficult to change ISA after CPU is in production

- Why not put every instruction on a chip?
    - Real-estate on a chip - silicon budget/transistors
        - More transistors => greater cost
    - Can't anticipate everything people will won't
    - Legacy support
        - Need to support all instructions you put on a chip
    - Complexity - hard to learn

- Interpreting words
    - Little endian -  least significant byte in smallest position
    - Big endian - most significant byte in smallest position

- Types of architectures (pros/cons in slides):
    - Stack
    - Accumulator
    - Memory-Memory
    - Register-Memory
    - Register-Register
